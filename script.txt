We'll briefly present the context.... of the problem
Then we will describe how .. solutions in the modeling step.
In point 3 and 4 we'll talk about our 

How is a vehicle modeled ?
Holds information about its motion and position :
acceleration
speed
position
desired trajectory (Trajectory Cell List)
It is a passive element. It can evolve, but it’s blind to other elements’ behaviour.
