We'll briefly present the context.... of the problem
Then we will describe how .. solutions in the modeling step.
In point 3 and 4 we'll talk about our two approaches: the solving via planning and the actual implementation of the protocol.

Our work is inspired by the paper 'titolo' by 'autori'...
It deals with traffic control in intersection, in the case of autonomous vehicles.
The inspiration of this work comes from the fact that intersection are the most dangerous structures in transportation and also the bottleneck since they require vehicles to slow down or stop.
So, an ideal solution would guarantee the safety of the intersection, while maximizing the throughput.
In the paper where the protocol is presented, is assumed that vehicles are autonomous and can communicate with each other.

The assumption about the world described in the reference paper are that
- Messages between vehicles do not get lost.
- A message is sent every tenth of a second.
- Vehicles always have perfect information about their position and the environment, thanks to GPS and digital maps.
- All vehicles have similar dimensions and shape.

Here's instead a picture of an intersection. As you can see the intersection is thought as a grid of cells: one cell for every intersection between lanes.

Let's talk about our modeling
We start with the modeling of vehicle:
The vehicle holds informations only about its motion and position, which are: acceleration, speed, position and desired trajectory. This is called Trajectory Cell List in the paper, or 'tcl'
The single vehicle is a passive element. It can evolve, but it’s blind to other elements’ behavior.

This is how the state of a car evolves

The intersection as we modeled receives the information from all the vehicles. It can command each vehicle to change its acceleration.
Its job is to adjust the car motion in order to guarantee safety.
These are the values represented in our model, which tries to represent reality as much as possible.

Discretization
In our model ..

The motion of a car inside the single cell is represented by an integer value, that we called progress. The progress of a car increase every step by its speed, when it reaches the threshold value, the vehicles goes to the next cell of its trajectory

The evolution of the entire system is of course represented in a sequence of finite time steps. Every time step .... of actual time. This is .. since in the reference paper the assumption in that vehicle communication happens times every second o 0.1 s

As a consequence of this settings, we have that position, speed and acceleration can only take integer values, bounded by a maximum and a minimum
Hence the number of possible states is finite

This is the analytic expression of the vehicle motion in the general case in which it is accelerating o decelerating at constant rate.
Obviously, it's a quadratic relation of the time ..., but it becomes a constant speed motion when the maximum speed is reached.
This equation will be needed later for the protocol implementation.
But before that, let's talk about the planning approach

The first question we need to ask is:
'Given our discretized model, is still possible for every configuration to let vehicle cross safely?'
'Can we satisfy the safties and liveness of the paper? Or we lost something in the modeling?'

We can answer this questions by first modeling the world, but without specifying the protocol. So the intersection has no rules to follow, it can change vehicles' speeds in any way.
The model checker will find a correct evolution for us

Let's see how it can be done.
This is what we want to find out:
From all possible ..., there exists a path such that
- no collisions between vehicles
- eventually every vehicles leaves the intersection
